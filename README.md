# Dawn of Empires

## What is the game about?

Since the beginning of the human race, empires have risen and fallen. This game allows you to control one empire in its search for glory and conquer all of the other weaker empires.

It is possible through three different ways: military power, culture overgrow or economic domination. The best thing: each one of these strategies have its advantages and disadvantages, so you must choose wisely which one of them to follow.

You can interact with each different empire and bargain for your interests. You can move your troops to extinguish weak soldiers. You can invest in your culture to show how advanced you are and how barbaric your neighboors are.

Come and conquer the world in your own way.

## What is the **goal**?

To win the game, you must be the first empire to win in any of the possible categories: culture, economy or military. You can have the best army in the world, but if another empire wins a culture victory sooner, you lose.
